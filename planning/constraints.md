Some boundaries around our project.

## External

- user friendliness
- technology stack
- design, UI/UX
- client satisfaction
- font, color, accessibility
<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over.

  - project deadlines
  - UI design or color schemes
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

- collecting relevant data
- mismatch of user personas
- members having no experience in the technology the client demands for the
  project
- unexpected sickness
- members not meeting deadlines

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over.
  They may include:
  - each of your individual skill levels

-->

## Internal: Voluntary

- code review by the project leader before every push
- following industry standards for coding
- 15 mins meeting every day to assess how the project is going

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
